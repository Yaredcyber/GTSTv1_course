        -linux kernel
        -packages(GNU)

        so many distro
     -> debian
      .kali linux
      .ubuntu      .parrot
    -> arch 
      .black      .arch     .garuda
     #fedora
     #red hat
     #gentoo

   --> KALI LINUX
     desktop env:xfce
     package manager:apt
     shell:zsh
    --> PARROT OS
     desktop env:mate
     package manager:apt
     shell:bash        
    --> GARUDA
      desktop env:kde plasma
      packege maneger:pacman
      shell:fish
